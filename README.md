## Project Guidelines

With your teammate you are to create a React application that shows dynamic data. This will require you to use an external api
You should only be spending 30 minutes ideating as the point of this application is to test your React knowledge without the constraints of test.

Your project should help you evaluate your knowledge in the following things:

* Props vs States - Can you pass down props (data & functions) from parent to child
* Events - Can you use the right events on your components to allow users to interact with your application
* Component LifeCycle - Can you you use the right lifecycle methods to fetch data 
* Smart vs Dumb Components - Do you differentiate between which components should hold your data and which should show it.

Remember that the power of React is its ability to divide responsibilities throughout the application. Therefore, we expect to see container components that handle larger responsibilities such as fetching and managing data while presentational components simply display our data
